# Week 2: Filesystem Hierarchy in Unix/Linux

**Filesystem Hierarchy in Unix/Linux:**
- All files and directories are organized under a single ancestor directory called the "root directory."
- Key directories include:
  - `/home`: Stores users' home directories.
  - `/bin`: Contains essential system binaries (commands).
  - `/usr/bin`: Holds common utilities (commands) for users.
  - `/usr/sbin`: Contains common utilities for system administration.
  - `/etc`: Stores system administration files, such as `passwd`.
  - `/var`: Contains dynamic files like log and mail files.
  - `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`: Used for temporary files generated by programs.
  - `/dev`: Contains device driver files for peripherals like terminals and printers.

**Working with Directories and Files:**
- `ls -d`: Lists the directory itself (excluding its contents).
- `ls -d -l`: Lists detailed information about the directory itself.
- `cp -R`: Copies a directory and its contents.
- `mv`: Moves or renames files and directories.
- `rmdir`: Removes an empty directory.
- `rm -r`: Safely removes a directory and its contents with a prompt.

**Text Editors:**
- `nano`: Used for simple text editing. Save and exit with Ctrl + X, then confirm with 'y.'
- `vi`: An advanced text editor with two modes: Input mode (i) and Command mode (ESC). Copy a line with 'yy' and paste with 'p.' Save and exit with ':x.'

**Useful Commands for Text Files:**
- `touch`: Creates empty files or updates an existing file's date/time stamp.
- `cat`: Displays text file contents without editing (suitable for small files).
- `more/less`: Displays and navigates large text files without editing (less provides advanced features).
- `cp`: Copies text files.
- `mv`: Moves or renames text files.
- `rm`: Removes text files.
- `sort`: Alphabetically sorts file contents (use -n for numerical sort, -r for reverse).
- `head`: Displays the first lines of a text file (default is 10 lines).
- `tail`: Displays the last lines of a text file (default is 10 lines).
- `grep`: Displays file contents that match a pattern.
- `uniq`: Displays unique consecutive lines only once.
- `diff`: Shows differences between two files.
- `file`: Provides information about the contents of a file.
- `find`: Searches for files based on specified characteristics.
